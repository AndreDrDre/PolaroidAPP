# PolaroidAPP
Fun, simple and intuitive Polaroid Type application designed to capture your special memories and display them as a Polaroid Camera would!

There is no setup required. Just run and start using! The application is developed using c# and Xamarin Studio. 

Further Notes:
________________

The Camera Button will not work on the ios simulator and needs to be deployed to a physical device.
I have added music media which you may turn of if you dont like. I hope you enjoy and capture alot of special Polaroid Memories!
